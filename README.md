# Taco Bueno, the open-source discord bot

This is the bot that is used for taco bueno, just with the token removed for security reasons.
This will not be updated often, so if you want me to update it, please contact me in my discord server.

## Important Bot Notes

- I love to use `code blocks` in the module.export function of the commands to make things more pretty
- Code may be inconsistant between commands, even though I use a linter.
- This ises discord.js v12
- This uses heroku as the hosting provider.

# Self hosting instructions
comming soon
